# Welcome to Your Enterprise Skill Library

> *Think of this as having senior engineers from Apple, Google, Meta, and NVIDIA on call — ready to mentor you through any challenge.*

---

## What Is This?

This is a collection of **skill files** that transform Claude from a generic assistant into specialized mentors. When you load a skill, Claude adopts the mindset and expertise of a senior professional in that domain.

**Without skills**: "Here's some code that might work."
**With skills**: "Let me walk you through this the way we'd approach it at Google. First, let's understand the problem..."

---

## How to Use This Library

### Step 1: Tell Claude What You're Doing

Don't jump straight into requests. Start with context:

> ❌ "Build me a login page"
>
> ✅ "I'm building a SaaS app and need to add user authentication. I've never done this before. Can you help me think through it?"

### Step 2: Load the Right Skill

Tell Claude which skill to use, or let it suggest one:

> "Load the **Product Strategist** skill — I need help writing a PRD for this feature."
>
> "I'm designing a dashboard. Can you help me with the **Design Systems** approach?"
>
> "Help me set up CI/CD. Use the **Release Engineer** skill."

### Step 3: Let Claude Guide You

The skills are designed to **coach you through thinking**, not just give you answers. Expect questions like:

- "What problem are you actually solving?"
- "How will you know if this worked?"
- "What happens if this fails?"

**Don't skip the questions.** They exist because senior engineers at these companies ask the same questions. The thinking is the point.

## Example Conversations

### "I have an idea for a feature"

> **You**: I want to add a dark mode to my app.
>
> **Claude** (with Product Strategist): Interesting! Before we design dark mode, let me ask: What problem does it solve? Is it user-requested? How will you measure if it's successful? Let's think through the PRD together...

### "I'm designing a screen"

> **You**: I need to design a settings page.
>
> **Claude** (with Design Systems): Before we design, who uses this page? What's the primary action? Is it complex enough to need sections? Let me walk you through Apple's approach to settings screens...

### "My tests are failing"

> **You**: My CI is red and I don't know why.
>
> **Claude** (with Release Engineer): Show me the error output. Let's debug together. While we fix this, I'll explain what each step in your pipeline is checking and why it matters...

## The Mindset Shift

These skills won't just help you build things — they'll help you **think like a senior engineer**.

| Junior Thinking | Senior Thinking (What Skills Teach) |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| "I'll just build it" | "First, let's define what success looks like" |
| "It works on my machine" | "Let's test it automatically, every time" |
| "The design looks fine" | "Can someone with low vision use this?" |
| "Ship it and fix later" | "Measure it, then ship with confidence" |

---

## Quick Start

1. **New to development?** Start with **Release Engineer** to set up proper CI/CD. Good habits from day one.

2. **Have a feature idea?** Start with **Product Strategist** to clarify what you're building and why.

3. **Building UI?** Load **Design Systems Lead** before writing any CSS.

4. **Ready to deploy?** Load **Release Engineer** for the pre-flight checklist.

---

## Getting Help

If you're stuck, just ask:

> "I don't know which skill to use for this..."
>
> "Can you explain this concept more simply?"
>
> "Walk me through this step by step."

The skills are designed to meet you where you are. There are no dumb questions — only learning opportunities.
